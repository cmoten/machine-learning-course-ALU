For the next xx days, we will learn the how of machine learning. This does not mean we are simply glossing over the why of machine learning, but quite frankly, we will not have the time in this short course. That being said, a good textbook reference to start learning the about the why of machine learning is the book [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman.
