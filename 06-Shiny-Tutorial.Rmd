# R Shiny Tutorial {#shiny-tut}

## What we will learn

After completing this short introduction to Shiny, we want to you know:

1. How to use Shiny
2. References to start learning basic design principles when creating Shiny apps

## Shiny Basics

We will not re-invent the wheel, but will learn Shiny through some basic, but useful examples found on the [R Shiny Tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/).

## Design Principles

1. Read [Better Presentations](https://policyviz.com/better-presentations/) by Jonathan Schwabish, [Storytelling With Data](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/book/) by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, and [Infomation Dashboard Design](https://www.amazon.com/Information-Dashboard-Design-Effective-Communication/dp/0596100167) by Stephen Few. You can also read this [technical report](http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=AD1025683) by Moten, Newton, and Jackson for an overview of the above material.

2. Read this [paper](http://www.theurbanclimatologist.com/uploads/4/4/2/5/44250401/mayermoreno2003reducingcognitiveoverload.pdf) by Mayer and Moreno that discusses the Cognitive Theory of Mulitmedia Learning and its applications.

3. Read Tamara Munzner's [Visualization Analysis and Design](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/) book.

4. Learn the [Gestalt Principles](http://www.tinker-entertainment.com/sitavriend/psychology-and-games/game-design-and-gestalt-laws/).

5. Learn about [Design Thinking](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/a-virtual-crash-course-in-design-thinking) and incorporate it into your workflow.

## Practical Exerecise {-}

Afterwards, we will work through some more complex examples.
