# Preface {-}

<img src="img/logo.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />



For the next two days, we will focus on the "how" of machine learning. This does not mean we are simply glossing over the "why" of machine learning, but quite frankly, we will not have the time in this short course. After we cover machine learning we will spend two days learning about R Shiny and will build a couple of web applications with it. Having said all that, a good textbook reference to start learning the about the "why" of machine learning mathematics is the book [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by @friedman2001elements. For a more hands-on approach, read [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by @nielsen2015nndl. 

## Structure of the book {-}
Chapter \@ref(ml-overview) provides a general overveiw of machine learning. Chapters \@ref(lin-algs) - \@ref(ml-pe) covers machine learning algorithms and a practical exercise. Chapters \@ref(shiny-tut) focuses on R shiny.
