#Machine Learning Overview

## What is machine Learning?

In simple terms, machine learning is a statistical modeling technique that focuses on algorithmic-driven models instead of data-driven models. [Dr. Leo Breiman](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726) (2001), shows a comparison of these two approaches in the figure below.

The model at the top shows the original problem to be solved? That problem is how to best represent the relationsip between a vector in input variables $x$ and a corresponding response variable $y$.
