# What you will learn

For the next xx days, we will learn the how of machine learning. This does not mean we are simply glossing over the why of machine learning, but quite frankly, we will not have the time in this short course. That being said, a good textbook reference to start learning the about the why of machine learning is the book [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. 



## What is machine Learning?

In simple terms, machine learning is a statistical modeling technique that focuses on algorithmic-driven models instead of data-driven models. [Dr. Leo Breiman](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726) (2001), shows a comparison of these two approaches in the figure below.

The model at the top shows the original problem to be solved? That problem is how to best represent the relationsip between a vector in input variables $x$ and a corresponding response variable $y$. 

## What do I need to know to get started with machine learning?

### The role of data in machine learning

### How do machine learning algorithms work?

### The difference between parametric and nonparametric machine learning algorithms

### The difference between supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning

### The bias-variance tradeoff

### Overfitting and underfitting and what to do about it
